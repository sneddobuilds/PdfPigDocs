# Introduction to PdfPig

PdfPig is an API to enable businesses to quickly and easily work with PDF files. 

We enable businesses to merge, compress and generate PDFs.

## Merging

Our merging endpoint enables businesses to take a number of pdf and image files and merge them together into a single pdf file.

## Compression

Our compression endpoint allows businesses to send us a pdf file, we will then compress that pdf and return it. Depending on the input file compression make a large reduction in file size.

## Generation

Our generation endpoint allows you pass a body of json and specify a template. We then generate a pdf based on the input. 

Our templates (managed via the template API) are html templates with liquid support. 

# Sign up

We are currently in a closed beta. If you are interested in using our service please contact [David on twitter](https://twitter.com/SneddoBuilds).

## Pricing model

Once we are live our pricing model will be based on transations. Some of the processes we perform are intensive in terms of server usage so our pricing model aims to charge based on actual usage. We believe this is the most fair model for a transactional service like this.
